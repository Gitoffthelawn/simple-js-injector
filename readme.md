## Simple JS Injector

This addon creates a small popup that lets you paste some JS code and inject it into the page you are currently seeing. 

This is a copycat Firefox version of JS injector from Daniel Han (https://github.com/hex0cter/js-injector) that is only available in Chrome (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/javascript-injector/ejnccfcackblkelbafbolcpjfpcmbplg).
